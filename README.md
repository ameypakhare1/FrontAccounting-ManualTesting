# FrontAccounting – Manual Testing Project

This is a manual testing project I completed as part of my training at **Quastech, Vashi**. I tested selected modules of the open-source ERP application **FrontAccounting** to gain hands-on experience in real-world software testing.

---

## Project Overview

- **Duration**: 1 week  
- **Mode**: Individual project (self-executed)  
- **Environment**: Installed FrontAccounting locally on a Windows 11 PC using XAMPP and MySQL  
- **Modules Tested**:
  - Sales Order
  - Purchase
  - Items and Inventory

Before starting the testing, I spent time understanding the full functionality of the application. This was my **first attempt at testing a full-scale project**, and it helped me build confidence and improve my testing skills.

## Project File

The project contains **one Excel file**, which is structured into three main sheets:

1. **Test Scenarios** – Lists the features I selected to test from each module.
2. **Test Cases** – Includes detailed test steps, test data, expected results, actual results, and status (Pass/Fail).
3. **Defect Report** – Contains the bugs I found during testing with proper description, steps to reproduce, and expected vs actual results.

## Key Bug Found

One of the major bugs I identified was that the system **allowed Sales Orders to be processed with backdated entries**, which could lead to data inconsistencies in real-time business environments.

## Learnings

- Understood the complete flow of a functional ERP module
- Learned how to break down features into testable parts
- Improved in writing clear, structured test cases and reporting bugs in a detailed format
- Gained hands-on experience in testing using a locally hosted environment
